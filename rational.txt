sensor: 0.5 to 4.5V <-> 0 to 60psi

convertion from 5V to 1V

dp = ro_w * g * dh <-> dh = dp / (ro_w * g)
ro_w = 1000kg/m^3
dh = dp / 10000

conversion from 0.1 to 0.9 <-> 0 to 60psi
Lets say that we have 60psi to 1024 points and we have an error of 20 points max.
60*20 / 1024 = 1.2 psi max

this implies a dp max of 8273pa
dh = 8000 / 10000 = 0.8m
dh_center = 0.4m
A good average might produce a 0.1m accuracy for the height. On a 5 meter well this is 2% error.
